# `Calorie_Based_Food_Recommendation_system`
The Calorie-Based Indian Food Recommendation System is a data-driven solution designed to provide users with personalized food recommendations from Indian cuisine based on their specified calorie preferences.


## `Project Name:`
Calorie_Based_Indian_Food_Recommendation_system

## `Project Description`:
The Calorie-Based Food Recommendation System recommends Indian foods based on the calories of the food to provide users with personalized food recommendations from Indian cuisine based on their specified calorie preferences. The system utilizes nutritional information from the ind-nutrient-api to suggest food options that align with the user's desired calorie intake.

## `Problem Statement:`
With the rise in health-conscious individuals and those looking to manage their calorie intake, there's a need for a tool that can help users make informed decisions about their food choices. The problem is to build a recommendation system that suggests Indian foods based on users' calorie preferences.

## `Business Need`:
The recommendation system addresses the need for a user-friendly tool that assists individuals in selecting suitable Indian dishes that match their specific calorie requirements. By offering personalized food suggestions, the system encourages healthier eating habits and enhances the overall dining experience.

## `Project Objectives`:
1. Develop a user-friendly interface for inputting calorie preferences.
2. Collect and preprocess nutritional data from the ind-nutrient-api.
3. Design and implement a recommendation algorithm based on calorie content.
4. Build a responsive application that provides food recommendations to users.


## `Deliverables`:
1. User interface for inputting calorie preferences.
2. Preprocessed and cleaned nutritional data from the ind-nutrient-api.
3. Recommendation algorithm based on calorie content.
4. Web-based application for food recommendations.
5. Documentation outlining the system architecture, data preprocessing, recommendation algorithm, and user guide.

## `Scope`:
The recommendation system will focus solely on suggesting Indian foods based on calorie preferences. It will not consider factors such as dietary restrictions, allergies, taste preferences, or cultural variations.

## `Assumptions and Limitations`:
- The accuracy of the recommendations heavily depends on the accuracy and completeness of the nutritional data provided by the ind-nutrient-api.
- The system assumes that users are aware of their calorie requirements and provide accurate input.
- The recommendation system does not consider other dietary aspects such as protein, carbohydrates, or fats.
- The system does not factor in individual health conditions, allergies, or specific dietary restrictions.

## `Future Enhancements`:
1. Incorporate additional dietary factors such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats to provide more comprehensive recommendations.
2. Expand the system to include recommendations for different cuisines.
3. Develop a mobile app version for convenience and wider accessibility.
4. Implement user profiles for tracking past preferences and recommendations.

## `Conclusion`:
The Indian Food Calorie-Based Recommendation System addresses the need for a personalized food recommendation solution based on users' calorie preferences. By leveraging nutritional data and a recommendation algorithm, the system empowers users to make healthier food choices while enjoying the rich flavors of Indian cuisine. As the system evolves and incorporates additional features, it will continue to enhance the dining experiences of users.
